# INTRO-WEB-7 - Introduction to Javascript Web Development

#### Exercise #1
You want to build a page that says "Hello name". Underneath the text will be a button that says, "Change the name!". 
When someone clicks the button, a prompt should pop up and ask, "What is your name?". The person is able to input a name into the prompt and the new text of the page should say, "Hello {inputted name}".

Make sure to use the built in `prompt()` function to get the name.

Hint: Use the DOM API to update the name.

#### Exercise #2

Take the blog post you have been building on [Introduction to Bootstrap Exercise #1](https://github.com/generation-org/INTRO-WEB/tree/master/INTRO-WEB-6%20Introduction%20To%20Bootstrap%20Framework#exercise-1).

Add in the ability to use Javascript on the page and create a new `.js` file.

In two sections of your blog, add in a button. When the buttons are clicked, an alert should show. In the alert, add in text that is relevant to the section where your button is. (ie. if it's a section about your hometown, a fun fact of the place).

#### Exercise #3

Go to a site from this [list](https://webdesignerwall.com/trends/30-truly-interactive-websites-built-css-javascript).
Inpect the CSS and HTML using the browser console. See if you can change certain styling elements using the browser console.

Once you are done looking at the page, pick three key elements of the page (ie. header, content body, and footer) and recreate the page on your own.
